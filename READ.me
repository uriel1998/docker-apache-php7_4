Dockerfile to bring up apache listening on port 8180
Using php7.4 because I have several webapps that simply aren't updated for php8
Meant to be used behind a reverse proxy.
Serves up sites configured in ./apache-sites (only updates on launch)
Site root available in ./www
Stores logs in ./logs

use run.sh and build.sh for standalone docker.
otherwise use docker-compose up
uses debian buster-slim as a base
